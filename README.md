# Anarchy 2090

Anarchy 2090 is a real-time cyberpunk-themed classic roguelike set in a dystopian future. Players accept and complete
procedurally generated missions while navigating a dangerous urban environment filled with hostile factions,
soul-less megacorps, advanced technology, and moral dilemmas.

The goal of the game is to rise through the ranks of a rebellious underground organization, taking on increasingly
challenging missions to undermine the oppressive regime controlling the city. Players must outfit their character,
upgrade their skills, and make moment to moment tactical decisions to survive and thrive in this harsh world.

## Systems

- **Procedural Generation**: The city layout, missions, and enemy placements are procedurally generated to ensure
  a unique experience with each playthrough.
- **Skills-based Progression**: There are no levels in Anarchy. Running missions will earn the player skill points, gear
  and credits they can use to improve their character's abilities and equipment.
- **Hunted**: As the player completes missions, their notoriety increases, causing more powerful enemies to hunt them
  down.
- **Dynamic Missions**: Missions adapt to the player's actions and choices, leading to different outcomes (and
  storylines?).
- **Cybernetic Enhancements**: Players can augment their characters with cybernetic implants that provide various
  abilities and stat boosts.
- **Tactical Combat**: Combat is real-time but requires strategic thinking, as players must manage resources,
  positioning,
  and abilities to overcome enemies.

### Gear Types

- **Weapons**: Ranged and melee weapons with various stats and special effects.
- **Armor**: Protective gear that reduces damage taken and may provide additional bonuses.
- **Cyberware**: Implants that enhance the player's abilities and stats. Every piece of cyberware has a power
  requirement that must be met to install it.
- **Consumables**: Items that provide temporary buffs, healing, or other effects.

### Stats and Skills

- **Muscle**: Affects melee damage and carry weight.
